# API-Coding-Quiz

*A simple quiz built from javascript and using localstorage*

## Description

The goal was to create a simple quiz that would show javascript coding questions for the user to answer. The focus was more on the javascript aspect rather than styling the site with CSS. Unfortunately, I struggled a lot with this assignment during the second half of the js code. I was able to get the  questions to show up and provide logic for the correct and incorrect answers. However, I was unable to get the timer to work and I was unable to get the highscores to show up. I believe my timer logic is fundamentally flawed in how I wrote it. I was aiming to make the scoring system tied to the timer itself, but perhaps I complicated it too much. Not only that, but I was struggling to get even localstorage working to store the user's initials and highscore. What I do have is a working coding quiz with a broken timer and highscore system. I will come back to this project and hopefully revamp it from the ground up to make it work.
