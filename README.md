# API-Coding-Quiz

*A simple quiz built from javascript and using localstorage*

## Description

The goal was to create a simple quiz that would show javascript coding questions for the user to answer. The focus was more on the javascript aspect rather than styling the site with CSS. Unfortunately, I struggled a lot with this assignment during the second half of the js code. I was able to get the  questions to show up and provide logic for the correct and incorrect answers. However, I was unable to get the timer to work and I was unable to get the highscores to show up. I believe my timer logic is fundamentally flawed in how I wrote it. I was aiming to make the scoring system tied to the timer itself, but perhaps I complicated it too much. Not only that, but I was struggling to get even localstorage working to store the user's initials and highscore. It wasn't until later on the 13th that I realized that the scoring system does work but only adds the extra leftover seconds from the first mutiple choice array. I'm still figuring out as to why this is. What I do have is a working coding quiz with logic to tell the user if there selected choice was right or wrong. The broken components are the timer and highscore system. I will come back to this project and hopefully revamp it from the ground up to make it work.

Use the inspect tool on your preferred browser to see the HTML structure of the page. You can also view the JS files. Localstorage is currently broken and does not display anything.
